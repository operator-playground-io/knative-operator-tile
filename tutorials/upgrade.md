###Upgrades
Upgrading the Knative operator will automatically trigger the upgrade of any existing KnativeServing and KnativeEventing instances, so you may want to create backups of them first:

kubectl get knativeserving --all-namespaces -o yaml >knativeserving.yaml
kubectl get knativeeventing --all-namespaces -o yaml >knativeeventing.yaml
Once you've created those backups, simply apply the new version of the operator and your knative upgrade will begin immediately.

If something goes wrong, you should re-apply the previous version of the operator, and then re-apply the backup files.
